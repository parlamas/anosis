	<center>ADVERBIAL CLAUSES</center><hr>

<ol>
<!--<li>Adverbial clauses of manner<p>
An adverbial clause of manner describes how the action described in the sentence’s main clause is taking place or previously took place. Here are a few examples:<p>

<ol type=a>
<li>She addressed the crowd <b>as she had practiced in the mirror.</b> (<span class="b">manner</span>)<br>
	Hun henvendte sig til mængden, som hun havde øvet sig i spejlet.<p>

<li>They designed the new product <b>the way innovators solve problems related to design flaws.</b> (<span class="b">manner</span>)<br>
	De designede det nye produkt, <b>som innovatører løser problemer relateret til designfejl.</b>
</ol><p>-->

<li>Adverbial clauses of place<p>

Adverbial clauses of place describe where the action in a sentence’s main clause takes place. See how they work in these examples:<p>

<ol type=a>
<li>My son told me another fight broke out <b>where he eats lunch at school.</b> (<span class="b">place</span>)<br>
	Min søn fortalte mig, at et andet slagsmål brød ud, <b>hvor han spiser frokost i skolen.</b> (bryde-brød-brudt)</b><p>

<li>They drove <b>beyond where the city ends.</b> (<span class="b">place</span>)<br>
	De kørte ud over, <b>hvor byen ender.</b>
</ol><p>


<li>Adverbial clauses of time<p>
Adverbial clauses of time communicate when the action in a sentence takes place:<p>

<ol type=a>
<li><b>Before she got home,</b> she called and ordered a pizza. (<span class="b">time</span>)<br>
	<b>Inden hun kom hjem,</b> ringede hun og bestilte en pizza.<p>

<li>The team assembled, dressed, and marched out <b>as the band were playing.</b> (<span class="b">time</span>)<br>
	Holdet samledes, klædte sig på og marcherede ud, <b>mens bandet spillede.</b>
</ol><p>


<li>Adverbial clauses of condition<p>
With an adverbial clause of condition, you can communicate the conditions related to the verb, adverb, or adjective in the sentence’s main clause.<p>
These examples demonstrate a few ways to use adverbial clauses of condition:<p>

<ol type=a>
<li>We’ll be sitting in the conference room <b>until they accept our terms.</b> (<span class="b">condition</span>)<br>
	Vi vil sidde i mødelokalet, <b>indtil de accepterer vores vilkår.</b><p>

<li><b>Whether my husband likes it or not,</b> we’ll be celebrating Christmas at my parents’ house. (<span class="b">condition</span>)<br>
	<b>Uanset om min mand kan lide det eller ej,</b> vil vi fejre jul hos mine forældre.
</ol><p>

<li>Adverbial clauses of reason<p>
Adverbial clauses of reason tell us the reason for the action being taken in the sentence’s main clause. These clauses generally use subordinating conjunctions like <i>because, unless,</i> and <i>since</i>.<p>
Here are a few examples of sentences that include adverbial clauses of reason:<p>

<ol type=a>
<li>We adopted these two cats <b>because we love them.</b> (<span class="b">reason</span>)<br>
  Vi adopterede disse to børn, <b>fordi vi elsker dem.</b><p>

  <li>They woke up late, <b>so they missed their flight.</b> (<span class="b">reason</span>)<br>
  De vågnede sent, <b>så de missede deres fly.</b><p>

<li>He’s amazing at dribbling <b>since he spent his youth playing for Barcelona.</b> (<span class="b">reason</span>)<br>
	Han er fantastisk til at drible, <b>siden han brugte sin ungdom på at spille for Barcelona.</b>
</ol><p>

<li>Adverbial clauses of purpose<p>
Like adverbial clauses of reason, adverbial clauses of purpose frequently involve subordinating conjunctions. These two kinds of clauses can look similar, but they have one key difference: While adverbial clauses of reason give the reason why something is happening, adverbial clauses of purpose explain the reason to take a specific action.<p>
Here are a few examples:

<ol type=a>
<li>We studied all night <b>so we would pass the exam.</b> (<span class="b">purpose</span>)<br>
	Vi studerede hele natten, <b>så vi ville bestå eksamen.</b><p>

<li><b>So that they could ease the traffic flow,</b> the event organizers split the group into three cohorts. (<span class="b">purpose</span>)<br>
	<b>For at de kunne lette trafikken,</b> delte arrangørerne gruppen op i tre kohorter.
</ol><p>

<li>Adverbial clauses of comparison<p>
Adverbial clauses of comparison are clauses that communicate how the subject of the dependent clause compares to the subject in the main clause.<p>

There are two types of adverbial clauses of comparison: adverbial clauses of comparison of degree and adverbial clauses of comparison of manner.<p>

Here are a few examples of adverbial clauses of comparison of <b>degree:</b><p>

<ol type=a>
<li>Theodore is as good at video games <b>as he is good at weight lifting.</b> (<span class="b">comparison of degree</span>)<br>
  Theodore er lige så god til videospil, <b>som han er god til vægtløftning.</b><p>

<li>We expected the afternoon class to perform better on the test <b>than they did last year.</b> (<span class="b">comparison of degree</span>)<br>
	Vi forventede, at eftermiddagsklassen ville klare sig bedre på testen, <b>end de gjorde sidste år.</b>
</ol><p>

Here are a few examples of adverbial clauses of comparison of <b>manner:</b><p>

<ol type=a start=3>
<li>The events unfolded <b>as the oracle prophesized.</b> (<span class="b">comparison of manner</span>)<br>
	Begivenhederne udspillede sig, <b>som oraklet profeterede.</b>
	<p>

<li>The invasion did not play out <b>as the dictator had hoped.</b> (<span class="b">comparison of manner</span>)<br>
		Invasionen udspillede sig ikke, <b>som diktatoren havde håbet.</b>
</ol><p>

<li>Adverbial clause of concession<p>
In an adverbial clause of concession, the writer <u>acknowledges</u> or <u>admits</u> a factor that modifies the main clause.<p>
Take a look at these adverbial clauses of concession:<p>

<ol type=a>
<li><b>Although they did their best,</b> they lost the game. (<span class="b">concession</span>)<br>
	<b>Selvom de gjorde deres bedste,</b> tabte de kampen.<p>

<li>The department head hired the first person they interviewed, <b>despite the fact that twenty people applied for the job.</b> (<span class="b">concession</span>)<br>
Afdelingslederen ansatte den første, de interviewede, <b>på trods af at tyve personer søgte jobbet.</b>
</ol>
</ol><hr>


<center>More examples of adverbial clauses</center><p>

Previously, we demonstrated how adverbial clauses can appear at the beginning or at the end of a sentence. They can also appear in the middle, as they do in these examples:<p>

<ol start=8>
<li>Our team, <b>whenever they win a match,</b> act like a swarm of bees and comes together as a cohesive unit.<br>
	Vores hold, <b>når de vinder en kamp,</b> fungerer som en bisværm og samles som en sammenhængende enhed.<p>

<li>Jill sat, <b>because her usual spot at the table was taken,</b> in a chair in the corner.<br>
	Jill sad, <b>fordi hendes sædvanlige plads ved bordet blev taget,</b> i en stol i hjørnet.
</ol><p>

Adverbial clauses can be long, sometimes even longer than the main clause:<p>

<ol start=11>
<li><b>Because there was ice on the road and I had already slipped and fallen twice in the last week,</b> I stayed home from school.<br>
	<b>Fordi der var is på vejen, og jeg allerede var skredet og faldet to gange i den sidste uge,</b> blev jeg hjemme fra skole.<p>

<li>My sister, <b>although she showed more resilience than I had ever seen her have before,</b> still finished the marathon second.<br>
	Min søster, <b>selvom hun viste mere modstandsdygtighed, end jeg nogensinde havde set hende have før,</b> afsluttede stadig maraton nummer to.<p>
</ol><p>

They can also be quite short:<p>

<ol start=13>
<li>I took out the trash <b>because it stunk.</b><br>
	Jeg tog skraldet ud, <b>fordi det stinkede.</b><p>

<li>It was dark in the hallway, <b>so Marta illuminated it</b> after she found a book of matches in her backpack.<br>
	Det var mørkt på gangen, <b>så Marta oplyste den,</b> efter hun havde fundet en tændstikbog i sin rygsæk.
</ol>

<li>Main/Base Verb<p>
	The <b>base</b> verb is the form of a verb where it has no ending (-ing, -ed, -en) added to it. It is also called the Root Verb since it is the very root form of a verb.<p>
		<ol type=a>
			<li>I <b>go</b> to school every day.
			<li>You <b>run</b> a mile every morning.
			<li><b>Do</b> your homework.
		</ol><p>

<li>Action Verbs
<li>Linking/Intensive Verb<p>

	A linking verb adds details about the subject of a sentence. In its simplest form, it connects the subject and the complement — that is, the words that follow the linking verb. It creates a link between them instead of showing action.<p>

Often, what is on each side of a linking verb is equivalent; the complement redefines or restates the subject.<p>

Generally, linking verbs are called "be" verbs which are <b>am, is, are, was, were,</b> have/has/had + <b>been.</b> However, there are some other verbs that can work as linking verbs. Those verbs are:<p>

<b>Act, feel, remain, appear, become, seem, smell, sound, grow, look, prove, stay, taste, turn.</b><p>

Some verbs in this list can also be action verbs. To figure out if they are linking verbs, you should try replacing them with forms of the be verbs. If the changed sentence makes sense, that verb is a linking verb.<p>

	<ol type=a>
		<li>She appears ready for the game. (She is ready for the game.)
		<li>The food seemed delicious. (The food was delicious.)
		<li>You look happy. (You are happy.)
	</ol><p>

<li>Auxiliary Verbs
<li>Modal Verbs
<li>Reflexive Verb
<li>Ergative Verb
<li>Phrasal Verb
<li>Lexical Verb
<li>Delexical Verb<p>
	<b>Delexical</b> Verbs lack importance when it comes to meaning since these Verbs hardly have meanings of their own when used individually. The meaning is taken out of the Verbs and put into the Noun. Take, have, make, give etc. are Delexical Verbs.<p>
		<ol type=a>
			<li>He <b>took</b> a shower.
			<li>I <b>had</b> a cold drink.
			<li>She <b>made</b> some arrangements.
		</ol><p>

<li>Stative/Being Verb
<li>Dynamic Verb
<li>Non-continuous Verb
<li>Intensive/Linking Verb<p>
	The Verbs that focus intensely on just the Subject are called Intensive Verbs. Intensive Verbs are also called Linking or Copular Verbs.<p>
	<ol type=a>
		<li>You seem happy.
		<li>It appears to be just perfect.
		<li>She looks stunning.
		<li>He's become rather irritable. 
	</ol><p>

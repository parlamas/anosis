<center>OLIVIA OM AT VÆRE ENENBARN</center><p>

Jamen altså, <span class="r">det at være</span><sub>1</sub> enebarn, det første jeg tænker på, det er at jeg synes, der er mange fordomme om det, og mange spørger mig, om jeg ikke har været forkælet <span class="r">i løbet af</span><sub>2</sub> min barndom, og det møder jeg også <span class="r">endda</span><sub>3</sub> fra venner, og det er jo noget, jeg bare må <span class="r">grine ad</span>,<sub>4</sub> fordi det føler jeg ikke, jeg har været. Min mor og far har jo ikke givet mig mere af den grund, og de har jo ikke haft <span class="r">alverdens</span><sub>5</sub> penge alligevel. Det er jo ikke noget, der kommer <span class="r">ud af den blå luft</span>,<sub>6</sub> bare fordi man ikke har søskende.<p>

Og så tror folk også altid, jeg ikke kan finde ud af at dele – eller at enebørn ikke kan finde ud af at dele, fordi vi ikke har haft nogen søskende til at skulle dele med. Men jeg har jo været i institutioner ligesom alle andre, hvor man lærer det – mere end derhjemme <span class="r">i virkeligheden</span>,<sub>7</sub> vil jeg tro. Og så tror jeg også en anden ting ved det at være enebarn, det er, at jeg <span class="r">er blevet god</span><sub>8</sub> til at være i mit eget selskab, fordi hvis min mor og far de ikke lige kunne være sammen med mig, eller der ikke var nogen venner, som jeg kunne lege med, så har jeg jo <span class="r">skullet være alene</span><sub>9</sub> og finde på noget selv. Det er ikke, fordi jeg ikke kan lide at være sammen med andre <span class="r">overhovedet</span>,<sub>10</sub> men jeg kan virkelig også godt finde ud af at være alene og er ikke bange for mit eget selskab i hvert fald.<p>


Og så tror jeg også, at jeg er blevet ret kreativ fra en tidlig alder, fordi jeg har skullet finde på mine egne lege, og fordi jeg skulle, ja, <span class="r">finde ud af</span>,<sub>11</sub> hvad jeg havde lyst til selv. Og jeg er muligvis også blevet bedre til at snakke med voksne <span class="r">fra en tidlig alder</span>.<sub>12</sub> Det er der også mange, der spørger mig om, fordi jeg har skullet være sammen med min mor og far i stedet for at kunne snakke med børn sådan omkring min alder.<p>

Og så er det også sjovt, at når jeg har kendt folk i et stykke tid, og de så <span class="r">får at vide</span>,<sub>13</sub> at jeg er enebarn, så er der rigtig mange, der siger at: ”Gud, er du enebarn, det virker du ellers ikke som.” Men det er da meget dejligt, synes jeg <span class="r">egentlig</span>,<sub>14</sub> at jeg ikke virker som den fordom, de havde omkring enebørn. Folk de spørger mig også ofte, om jeg kunne tænke mig at have søskende, <span class="r">men ærligt talt</span><sub>15</sub> så... det kunne jeg slet ikke <span class="r">forestille mig</span>,<sub>16</sub> hvordan skulle føles at have en bror eller en søster, for jeg har aldrig prøvet det, og jeg forstår ikke det forhold, man har til hinanden, rigtigt. For det eneste jeg kan <span class="r">tænke mig til</span>,<sub>17</sub> det er, at det måske føles som at have en ven <span class="r">boende</span><sub>18</sub> i ens hus, som man skal dele sine forældre med. Og det kan jeg da forestille mig, både er hyggeligt, men også <span class="r">sådan</span><sub>19</sub> lidt irriterende <span class="r">nogle gange</span><sub>20</sub> måske.

<div style="width:90%; text-align:justify;">
	Well, being an only child, the first thing that comes to my mind is that I think there are a lot of prejudices about it, and many people ask me if I haven't been spoiled during my childhood, and I even meet that from friends, and it's something I just have to laugh at, because I don't feel like I've been. My mother and father didn't give me more for that reason, and they didn't have a lot of money anyway. It's not something that comes out of the blue just because you don't have siblings.<p>

And then people also always think that I can't figure out how to share - or that only children can't figure out how to share because we haven't had any siblings to share with. But I have been in institutions like everyone else, where you learn it - more than at home in reality, I would think. And then I also think another thing about being an only child is that I have become good at being in my own company, because if my mother and father could not be with me, or there was no one friends with whom I could play, I have had to be alone and come up with something myself. It's not because I don't like being with other people at all, but I can really handle being alone and I'm not afraid of my own company anyway.<p>

And then I also think that I became quite creative from an early age because I had to come up with my own games and because I had to, well, find out what I wanted to do myself. And I may also have gotten better at talking to adults from an early age. Many people also ask me that because I have had to be with my mother and father instead of being able to talk to children around my age.<p>

And then it's also funny that when I've known people for a while, and they then learn that I'm an only child, there are a lot of people who say: "God, you're an only child, you seem like that otherwise not as.” But it's really nice, I think, that I don't seem like the prejudice they had about only children. People also often ask me if I would like to have siblings, but honestly... I couldn't even imagine what it would be like to have a brother or a sister, because I've never tried it, and I don't really understand the relationship you have with each other. Because the only thing I can think of is that it might feel like having a friend living in your house with whom you have to share your parents. And I can imagine that, both nice, but also a little annoying sometimes.

WHAT CAN PARENTS DO?<p>
Of course, a one-year-old and a four-year-old should not be treated the same, but as far as possible they should feel equally loved by their parents. And greater awareness of how we as parents bring up is the first (1) step to give the children a high self-esteem. Because when we know how the way we treat the children can (2) affect them for the rest of their lives, we can practice managing around the pitfalls.<p>

In other words, we can practice sending little brother into town so he can learn some responsibility, and (3) spare big sister so she gets a breather and maybe some alone time with her mother. And we can remember to (4) include the perhaps slightly overlooked middle child. Greater knowledge can (5) mean that we parents can make an effort on a daily basis to make choices that help make our children more harmonious and self-confident.<p>

It is hard work to break or just adjust a learned pattern, but it can (6) be done. But first you have to see why you have been given the role you have. Once you've done that, your siblings' roles suddenly make more (7) sense. The fights and conflicts between adult siblings can be reduced when we gain (8) insight into the importance of sibling relationships.

<div style="font-size:10pt; text-align:justify;">
THE OLDEST<p>
As the first born, you get a lot of attention from your parents. The first years you are the only one
child, and the parents will always be very concerned about the child and its development and their own ability to
to be good parents. All that attention will of course be stimulating and developing for
the child and give him self-confidence.<p>

The first born will naturally always be the biggest and most talented of the children and therefore get the most
recognition and admiration from parents. The parents are usually very concerned about what the eldest
can, and has high expectations of him or her. The eldest often takes over the parents' ambitions
and makes an effort to become skilled and in that way gain the acceptance and admiration of the parents. The oldest
child will also later in life try to prove his worth and need praise and recognition from others -
the teachers, colleagues and the boss.<p>

When the second child is born, the eldest must fight to keep the parents' attention and
his position in the family. So the eldest is used to fighting for his position through his upbringing and
decide over others, but also used to looking after the younger siblings and protecting them.
The parents raise mostly the eldest. It has actually been proven that the oldest child gets scolded more
than his younger siblings. The consequence is that the oldest child tries to behave correctly and stays
more faithful to authority than the younger ones.<p>

All these conditions may be the reason why many eldest children become leaders. They are brought up to work
hard, they are well stimulated - the parents talk mostly with the oldest - and it comes naturally to them to
take responsibility, rule over others, make decisions on behalf of others and provide for others. Moreover
they do not like having a boss, because they are not used to others ruling over them. A very
a large proportion of top politicians and business leaders are the eldest son and nurses, psychologists and
social workers the eldest daughter. Today, the gender role pattern is changing, so there are also more
older sisters in leadership positions.<p>

It is easy for parents to leave responsibility to the oldest child, because they are often very willing to take it,
while the younger ones will protest. But if you want to treat your children more equally, it might be a good idea to
beware of making too great demands of the great and showing them too much admiration. It is better to give
the elder more freedom and let some of the responsibilities and duties pass on to the next i
the line of siblings.<hr>

<div style="font-size:10pt; text-align:justify;">
THE MIDDLE<p>
Being the middle child can be a difficult position, especially if there is a short distance between
the children, and especially if there are three children of the same sex, that is, if one is the middle of three brothers
or three sisters. The middle child may have difficulty getting attention and recognition from the parents,
because there is no special role for him or her. After all, the oldest will always be the wisest and most capable
and the youngest the small, sweet, charming. The parents will typically talk mostly with the older one and play
have fun with the little one. But if the middle one is a boy between two girls, he will be in something special
force of her gender, and the same of course applies if it is a girl between two boys. If there are three fours
years between the children, there will be enough time and money to give the middle one as well
attention.<p>

But the "squeezed" middle child, for example a girl between two sisters with a small age difference, can feel
being overlooked and not getting enough care and attention. She often seeks community outside the family, has
more friends than his siblings and may leave home before them. Many middle sisters become more
independent than their sisters because they seek out the family, others withdraw into themselves and live in one
fantasy world.<p>

But it develops some special abilities to be the middle one. The middle child stands in the middle between the big one
and the small one and must in many cases mediate between them. He or she can become good at listening to others
and become more adaptable and flexible than his siblings. The middle child doesn't stay as often
leader, but as one who is accustomed to set aside himself and mediate between others, he becomes the middle one
a good and compromise-seeking middle manager as an adult.<hr>

            <div class="p"><b>page 6</b></div><p>

<div style="font-size:10pt; text-align:justify;">
THE YOUNGEST<p>
It has been said that the oldest child is typically loved for what he does, while the youngest child stays
loved for what he is. The youngest will always be the small, sweet and funny one and always the most helpless
relationship with his older siblings. Therefore, he will appeal more for protection and care from the parents
side and must not live up to the high demands the parents place on the big one. The oldest child might be “the
big" in the eyes of the parents already from the age of 2-3, while the youngest child is "the little one" right up to
the teenage years. In many cases, the youngest is allowed to play and is so used to it that no demands are made
to him that it does not even occur to him to help with the practical.<p>

The youngest often becomes less loyal to authority because the parents educate him or her less than
on the older siblings. The parents can't bear to bring up that much more and may also be smaller
worried than when they had their first child. This gives the youngest a greater freedom. But the parents have
difficulty in considering the youngest as great and responsible and forgets to give him duties and responsibilities. That
can mean that the youngest child in many cases becomes less responsible and dutiful than them
older sibling and more changeable and rebellious towards authority.<p>

It is impossible for the youngest to live up to the older siblings. A child cannot compete with anyone,
there are several years older than itself, and the older siblings do not accept attempts at competition either
from the youngest. So the youngest may as well concentrate on what he or she wants and go
as an adult often makes his own way and finds a job and a lifestyle that is completely different from that of his parents.<p>

The youngest does not have the elder's need to become a leader. If they start their own company, they often stay
more "alternative" bosses who give the employees more freedom than the more authoritarian big brother or
big sister.

<div style="font-size:10pt; text-align:justify;">
THE ONLY CHILD<p>

The only child gets the parents' full attention and love. They must not at any time in their
childhood share it with someone and will typically feel very loved. Of course, it will give them great
self confidence. But they also get used to the fact that everything in the family is about them, so they can also stay a little
self recording oath.<p>

Only children must be everything to their parents and are met with great demands from the parents, who will do everything
to live up to. Therefore, they often become responsible and perfectionistic and make high demands on themselves.<p>

When children have siblings, they will spend much of their time playing with each other. But when there isn't
other children in the family, the child will have a lot of adult contact. When there are more children, they will typically go quickly
from the table and play when they have eaten, but if there are no other children, they stay and talk
the adults. Adult guests also approach the only child, so that he gets used to talking to adults and
communicates well with people older than themselves. You often see that only children remain
old wise and articulate at an early age. On the other hand, they may find it difficult to get along with others
children because they do not know the codes between children from home.<p>

Children with siblings grow up with eternal competition for everything and are very aware of whether
things are distributed fairly. Only children are often very relaxed about this. They are not used to fighting
things or argue, as siblings do, so they don't become like that later in life either
competitive as children with siblings.<p>
	
In some ways, the only children are similar to the oldest children, but they are not so used to ruling over others
or fight for their power. Later on, they don't go for management positions either, but would rather have one
work where they can immerse themselves in their own projects and work with what they want. They always have
could play whatever they wanted without having to conform to older siblings. Prestige is not that important to
them, because they never had to fight for their parents' recognition, but always got it without a fight. That
has given them self-confidence, so that they do not later have to fight for the recognition of their surroundings.
